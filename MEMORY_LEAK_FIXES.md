# Memory Leak Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed 7 critical memory leaks and bugs in the ComfyUI-LatentSyncWrapper to prevent crashes and memory exhaustion during video processing.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. PIL Image Memory Leaks (3 fixes)
- **nodes.py:971**: Added `frame.close()` after converting PIL Image to tensor
- **long_video_handler.py:112**: Added `img.close()` after loading frames
- **long_video_handler.py:150**: Added `img.close()` after saving processed frames

### 2. VideoReader Memory Leak
- **nodes.py:943**: Added `del vr` to properly release decord VideoReader

### 3. GPU Memory Synchronization
- **memory_limiter.py:37**: Fixed order - now calls `torch.cuda.synchronize()` BEFORE `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`

### 4. Windows Hardcoded Path Fix
- **nodes.py:444**: Added platform check - only applies Windows-specific path on Windows systems

### 5. inference_module Memory Leak
- **nodes.py:804**: Added `del inference_module` to release the entire module after cleanup

## Impact
These fixes address:
- **Memory exhaustion** during long video processing
- **GPU memory leaks** from improper cache clearing
- **Cross-platform compatibility** issues
- **Resource leaks** from unclosed file handles

## Safety Notes
All fixes are:
- **Non-breaking**: Only add cleanup code, don't change functionality
- **Backward compatible**: Existing workflows continue to work
- **Platform aware**: Properly handle different operating systems
- **Error resilient**: Don't introduce new failure points

## Remaining Issues (Not Fixed - Would Require Larger Changes)
1. Global variable race conditions (MODULE_TEMP_DIR)
2. Complex temp directory management system
3. Error handling with bare except clauses
4. Some resource cleanup in finally blocks with ignore_errors=True

These would require more significant refactoring to fix safely.
